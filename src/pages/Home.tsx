      <h1>Welcome to B Off-Leash</h1>
      <h2>If you love your dog, I'll train your dog!</h2>
      <br />
      <p>B Off-Leash is inspired by the training I did with my dog Bueller.
         Growing with him and seeing what we're both capable has become a way for others
         to be able to trust me with their beloved dogs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I believe every dog has the potential to be a well-behaved and joyful addition to any family
        or environment. A little patience goes a long way and I will provide you with all of the 
        techniques and tips I can to support my lessons once your dog and I part ways.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I want to help you strengthen your bond with your dog and regulate any issues there may be. 
        <strong> Just like B, your dog can be off-leash soon too!</strong>
      </p>
