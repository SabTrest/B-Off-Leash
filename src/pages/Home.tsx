      <h1>Welcome to B Off-Leash</h1>
      <h2>If you love your dog, I’ll help you bring out their very best!</h2>
      <br />
      <p>B Off-Leash was inspired by the journey I’ve taken with my own dog, Bueller. Watching him 
        grow in confidence, obedience, and joy showed me what’s possible when the right guidance meets 
        a dog who’s eager to learn. Now, I’m proud to help other families experience that same transformation.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Every dog has unlimited potential - they just need the right support. With patience-based, relationship-focused 
        training, I teach both dogs and their humans the skills needed for success. You’ll receive practical tools and 
        tips to keep progress going long after each session ends.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My goal is simple: a stronger bond, a happier household, and a dog you can trust on- and eventually off-leash.
        I want to help you strengthen your bond with your dog and regulate any issues there may be. 
      </p>
        <strong> Just like B, your dog can be off-leash soon too!</strong>
      <p>  
        Let's unlock that potential together.
